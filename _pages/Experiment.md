While working on digitalisation of endangered site, we realised that scanning technique can be complex or expansive and might not be adapted to bad footage. As we are working on existing footage to replicate lost heritage, we need process adapted to footage not meant for scanning such as blured video or low resolution images.

The experiments explore different ways to either capture or render 3D model with low cost.
